This web application is for certification tree tracking.

This is currently in beta and looking for additional front end designers and developers to work on the views.

Database backup is provided to get this application running locally, if you are a windows user and new to development
downloading and learning to use www.wampserver.com/en/ for your local webserver and datbase needs
and
notepad-plus-plus.org for editing files is a great way to get started with minimal trouble.

Current Bugs:
MANA Vehicle Turret shows as everyone has one
*Problem is, everyone has the item listed from the API, current theory is that it is unlocked for use. But the skill list shows no evidence of unlocking it.

Current Features:

    Table of members in VCO with active links
    Table updated to show more information on users, shows some interesting statistics
    Clicking on link will show you what items you have in relation to the tier groups
    MVC has been implemented


Planned Features for version 1:

    Ability to create certification trees through a UI
    Fix grouping of suits and vehicles, nanoweave for medic shows under medic, unlocks for vehicles shows under that vehicle, etc
    Adjust to allow logic, like assigning equipment or entire branches of a cert tree as "Required / Or / Optional"
    Track cert costs for items and show total Cert costs for Trees and Branches
    Show estimated time of unlocking a cert tree given current free certs and projected cert/minute gain


Future Plans for version 2:

    Open App for any oufit to utilize for their own uses
    Move App to a proper web address for VCO
    Login and authentication for users
    A personal tree plan for different users
