See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql-indexes.html. The DISTINCT\nkeyword can be used to find the minimum of the distinct values of expr,\nhowever, this produces the same result as omitting DISTINCT.\n\nMIN() returns NULL if there were no matching rows.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/group-by-functions.html\n\n', 'mysql> SELECT student_name, MIN(test_score), MAX(test_score)\n    ->        FROM student\n    ->        GROUP BY student_name\n', 'http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/group-by-functions.html'),

The latter accepts only table_reference, not a list of them\ninside a pair of parentheses.\n\nThis is a conservative extension if we consider each comma in a list of\ntable_reference items as equivalent to an inner join. For example:\n\nSELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2, t3, t4)\n                 ON (t2.a=t1.a AND t3.b=t1.b AND t4.c=t1.c)\n\nis equivalent to:\n\nSELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2 CROSS JOIN t3 CROSS JOIN t4)\n                 ON (t2.a=t1.a AND t3.b=t1.b AND t4.c=t1.c)\n\nIn MySQL, CROSS JOIN is a syntactic equivalent to INNER JOIN (they can\nreplace each other). In standard SQL, they are not equivalent. INNER\nJOIN is used with an ON clause, CROSS JOIN is used otherwise.\n\nIn general, parentheses can be ignored in join expressions containing\nonly inner join operations. MySQL also supports nested joins (see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/nested-join-optimization.html).\n\nIndex hints can be specified to affect how the MySQL optimizer makes\nuse of indexes. For more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/index-hints.html.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/join.html\n\n', 'SELECT left_tbl.*\n  FROM left_tbl LEFT JOIN right_tbl ON left_tbl.id = right_tbl.id\n  WHERE right_tbl.id IS NULL\n', 'http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/join.html'),

This means that as\nsoon as you execute a statement that updates (modifies) a table, MySQL\nstores the update on disk to make it permanent.\n\nTo disable autocommit mode implicitly for a single series of\nstatements, use the START TRANSACTION statement:\n\nSTART TRANSACTION\nSELECT @A:=SUM(salary) FROM table1 WHERE type=1\nUPDATE table2 SET summary=@A WHERE type=1\nCOMMIT\n\nWith START TRANSACTION, autocommit remains disabled until you end the\ntransaction with COMMIT or ROLLBACK. The autocommit mode then reverts\nto its previous state.\n\nYou can also begin a transaction like this:\n\nSTART TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT\n\nThe WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT option starts a consistent read for\nstorage engines that are capable of it. This applies only to InnoDB.\nThe effect is the same as issuing a START TRANSACTION followed by a\nSELECT from any InnoDB table. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-consistent-read.html. The\nWITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT option does not change the current transaction\nisolation level, so it provides a consistent snapshot only if the\ncurrent isolation level is one that permits consistent read (REPEATABLE\nREAD or SERIALIZABLE).\n\n*Important*: Many APIs used for writing MySQL client applications (such\nas JDBC) provide their own methods for starting transactions that can\n(and sometimes should) be used instead of sending a START TRANSACTION\nstatement from the client. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/connectors-apis.html, or the\ndocumentation for your API, for more information.\n\nTo disable autocommit mode explicitly, use the following statement:\n\nSET autocommit=0\n\nAfter disabling autocommit mode by setting the autocommit variable to\nzero, changes to transaction-safe tables (such as those for InnoDB or\nNDBCLUSTER) are not made permanent immediately. You must use COMMIT to\nstore your changes to disk or ROLLBACK to ignore the changes.\n\nautocommit is a session variable and must be set for each session.

It also updates the contents of the\nmaster.info and relay-log.info files. To use CHANGE MASTER TO, the\nslave replication threads must be stopped (use STOP SLAVE if\nnecessary).\n\nOptions not specified retain their value, except as indicated in the\nfollowing discussion. Thus, in most cases, there is no need to specify\noptions that do not change. For example, if the password to connect to\nyour MySQL master has changed, you just need to issue these statements\nto tell the slave about the new password:\n\nSTOP SLAVE -- if replication was running\nCHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_PASSWORD=''new3cret''\nSTART SLAVE -- if you want to restart replication\n\nMASTER_HOST, MASTER_USER, MASTER_PASSWORD, and MASTER_PORT provide\ninformation to the slave about how to connect to its master:\n\no MASTER_HOST and MASTER_PORT are the host name (or IP address) of the\n  master host and its TCP/IP port.\n\n  *Note*: Replication cannot use Unix socket files. You must be able to\n  connect to the master MySQL server using TCP/IP.\n\n  If you specify the MASTER_HOST or MASTER_PORT option, the slave\n  assumes that the master server is different from before (even if the\n  option value is the same as its current value.) In this case, the old\n  values for the master binary log file name and position are\n  considered no longer applicable, so if you do not specify\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS in the statement,\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE='''' and MASTER_LOG_POS=4 are silently appended to it.\n\n  Setting MASTER_HOST='''' (that is, setting its value explicitly to an\n  empty string) is not the same as not setting MASTER_HOST at all.\n  Beginning with MySQL 5.5, trying to set MASTER_HOST to an empty\n  string fails with an error. Previously, setting MASTER_HOST to an\n  empty string caused START SLAVE subsequently to fail. (Bug #28796)\n\no MASTER_USER and MASTER_PASSWORD are the user name and password of the\n  account to use for connecting to the master.\n\n  In MySQL 5.5.20 and later, MASTER_USER cannot be made empty setting\n  MASTER_USER = '''' or leaving it unset when setting a value for for\n  MASTER_PASSWORD causes an error (Bug #13427949).\n\n  Currently, a password used for a replication slave account can exceed\n  32 characters, but any characters in excess of this number are\n  truncated. This is not due to any limit imposed by the MySQL Server\n  but rather one that is specific to MySQL Replication. (See Bug\n  #43439, for more information.)\n\n  The text of a running CHANGE MASTER TO statement, including values\n  for MASTER_USER and MASTER_PASSWORD, can be seen in the output of a\n  concurrent SHOW PROCESSLIST statement.\n\nThe MASTER_SSL_xxx options provide information about using SSL for the\nconnection. They correspond to the --ssl-xxx options described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/ssl-options.html, and\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-solutions-ssl.html.\nThese options can be changed even on slaves that are compiled without\nSSL support. They are saved to the master.info file, but are ignored if\nthe slave does not have SSL support enabled.\n\nMASTER_CONNECT_RETRY specifies how many seconds to wait between connect\nretries. The default is 60. The number of reconnection attempts is\nlimited by the --master-retry-count server option for more\ninformation, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-options.html.\n\nThe MASTER_BIND option is available in MySQL Cluster NDB 7.2 and later,\nbut is not supported in mainline MySQL 5.5.\n\nMASTER_BIND is for use on replication slaves having multiple network\ninterfaces, and determines which of the slave''s network interfaces is\nchosen for connecting to the master.\n\nMASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD sets the interval in seconds between\nreplication heartbeats. Whenever the master''s binary log is updated\nwith an event, the waiting period for the next heartbeat is reset.\ninterval is a decimal value having the range 0 to 4294967 seconds and a\nresolution in milliseconds the smallest nonzero value is 0.001.\nHeartbeats are sent by the master only if there are no unsent events in\nthe binary log file for a period longer than interval.\n\nSetting interval to 0 disables heartbeats altogether. The default value\nfor interval is equal to the value of slave_net_timeout divided by 2.\n\nSetting @@global.slave_net_timeout to a value less than that of the\ncurrent heartbeat interval results in a warning being issued. The\neffect of issuing RESET SLAVE on the heartbeat interval is to reset it\nto the default value.\n\nMASTER_LOG_FILE and MASTER_LOG_POS are the coordinates at which the\nslave I/O thread should begin reading from the master the next time the\nthread starts. RELAY_LOG_FILE and RELAY_LOG_POS are the coordinates at\nwhich the slave SQL thread should begin reading from the relay log the\nnext time the thread starts. If you specify either of MASTER_LOG_FILE\nor MASTER_LOG_POS, you cannot specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS.\nIf neither of MASTER_LOG_FILE or MASTER_LOG_POS is specified, the slave\nuses the last coordinates of the slave SQL thread before CHANGE MASTER\nTO was issued. This ensures that there is no discontinuity in\nreplication, even if the slave SQL thread was late compared to the\nslave I/O thread, when you merely want to change, say, the password to\nuse.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO deletes all relay log files and starts a new one,\nunless you specify RELAY_LOG_FILE or RELAY_LOG_POS. In that case, relay\nlog files are kept the relay_log_purge global variable is set silently\nto 0.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.5, RELAY_LOG_FILE required an absolute path. In MySQL\n5.5, the path can be relative, and uses the same basename as\nMASTER_LOG_FILE. (Bug #12190)\n\nIGNORE_SERVER_IDS was added in MySQL 5.5. This option takes a\ncomma-separated list of 0 or more server IDs. Events originating from\nthe corresponding servers are ignored, with the exception of log\nrotation and deletion events, which are still recorded in the relay\nlog.\n\nIn circular replication, the originating server normally acts as the\nterminator of its own events, so that they are not applied more than\nonce. Thus, this option is useful in circular replication when one of\nthe servers in the circle is removed. Suppose that you have a circular\nreplication setup with 4 servers, having server IDs 1, 2, 3, and 4, and\nserver 3 fails. When bridging the gap by starting replication from\nserver 2 to server 4, you can include IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = (3) in the\nCHANGE MASTER TO statement that you issue on server 4 to tell it to use\nserver 2 as its master instead of server 3. Doing so causes it to\nignore and not to propagate any statements that originated with the\nserver that is no longer in use.\n\nIf a CHANGE MASTER TO statement is issued without any IGNORE_SERVER_IDS\noption, any existing list is preserved RESET SLAVE also has no effect\non the server ID list. To clear the list of ignored servers, it is\nnecessary to use the option with an empty list:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = ()\n\nIf IGNORE_SERVER_IDS contains the server''s own ID and the server was\nstarted with the --replicate-same-server-id option enabled, an error\nresults.\n\nAlso beginning with MySQL 5.5, the master.info file and the output of\nSHOW SLAVE STATUS are extended to provide the list of servers that are\ncurrently ignored. For more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/slave-logs-status.html, and\n[HELP SHOW SLAVE STATUS].\n\nBeginning with MySQL 5.5.5, invoking CHANGE MASTER TO causes the\nprevious values for MASTER_HOST, MASTER_PORT, MASTER_LOG_FILE, and\nMASTER_LOG_POS to be written to the error log, along with other\ninformation about the slave''s state prior to execution.\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO is useful for setting up a slave when you have the\nsnapshot of the master and have recorded the master binary log\ncoordinates corresponding to the time of the snapshot. After loading\nthe snapshot into the slave to synchronize it to the slave, you can run\nCHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_LOG_FILE=''log_name'', MASTER_LOG_POS=log_pos on\nthe slave to specify the coordinates at which the slave should begin\nreading the master binary log.\n\nThe following example changes the master server the slave uses and\nestablishes the master binary log coordinates from which the slave\nbegins reading. This is used when you want to set up the slave to\nreplicate the master:\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO\n  MASTER_HOST=''master2.mycompany.com'',\n  MASTER_USER=''replication'',\n  MASTER_PASSWORD=''bigs3cret'',\n  MASTER_PORT=3306,\n  MASTER_LOG_FILE=''master2-bin.001'',\n  MASTER_LOG_POS=4,\n  MASTER_CONNECT_RETRY=10\n\nThe next example shows an operation that is less frequently employed.\nIt is used when the slave has relay log files that you want it to\nexecute again for some reason. To do this, the master need not be\nreachable. You need only use CHANGE MASTER TO and start the SQL thread\n(START SLAVE SQL_THREAD):\n\nCHANGE MASTER TO\n  RELAY_LOG_FILE=''slave-relay-bin.006'',\n  RELAY_LOG_POS=4025\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/change-master-to.html\n\n', '', 'http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/change-master-to.html'),

For rules covering the naming\nof tablespaces, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/identifiers.html.\n\n*Note*: All MySQL Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace.\nThis means that each Disk Data object must be uniquely named (and not\nmerely each Disk Data object of a given type). For example, you cannot\nhave a tablespace and a log file group with the same name, or a\ntablespace and a data file with the same name.\n\nA log file group of one or more UNDO log files must be assigned to the\ntablespace to be created with the USE LOGFILE GROUP clause.\nlogfile_group must be an existing log file group created with CREATE\nLOGFILE GROUP (see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-logfile-group.html).\nMultiple tablespaces may use the same log file group for UNDO logging.\n\nThe EXTENT_SIZE sets the size, in bytes, of the extents used by any\nfiles belonging to the tablespace. The default value is 1M. The minimum\nsize is 32K, and theoretical maximum is 2G, although the practical\nmaximum size depends on a number of factors. In most cases, changing\nthe extent size does not have any measurable effect on performance, and\nthe default value is recommended for all but the most unusual\nsituations.\n\nAn extent is a unit of disk space allocation. One extent is filled with\nas much data as that extent can contain before another extent is used.\nIn theory, up to 65,535 (64K) extents may used per data file however,\nthe recommended maximum is 32,768 (32K). The recommended maximum size\nfor a single data file is 32G---that is, 32K extents x 1 MB per extent.\nIn addition, once an extent is allocated to a given partition, it\ncannot be used to store data from a different partition an extent\ncannot store data from more than one partition. This means, for example\nthat a tablespace having a single datafile whose INITIAL_SIZE is 256 MB\nand whose EXTENT_SIZE is 128M has just two extents, and so can be used\nto store data from at most two different disk data table partitions.\n\nYou can see how many extents remain free in a given data file by\nquerying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table, and so derive an estimate\nfor how much space remains free in the file. For further discussion and\nexamples, see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/files-table.html.\n\nThe INITIAL_SIZE parameter sets the data file''s total size in bytes.\nOnce the file has been created, its size cannot be changed however,\nyou can add more data files to the tablespace using ALTER TABLESPACE\n... ADD DATAFILE. See [HELP ALTER TABLESPACE].\n\nINITIAL_SIZE is optional its default value is 128M.\n\nOn 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for INITIAL_SIZE is 4G.\n(Bug #29186)\n\nWhen setting EXTENT_SIZE or INITIAL_SIZE (either or both), you may\noptionally follow the number with a one-letter abbreviation for an\norder of magnitude, similar to those used in my.cnf. Generally, this is\none of the letters M (for megabytes) or G (for gigabytes).\n\nINITIAL_SIZE, EXTENT_SIZE, and UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE are subject to rounding\nas follows:\n\no EXTENT_SIZE and UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE are each rounded up to the nearest\n  whole multiple of 32K.\n\no INITIAL_SIZE is rounded down to the nearest whole multiple of 32K.\n\n  For data files, INITIAL_SIZE is subject to further rounding the\n  result just obtained is rounded up to the nearest whole multiple of\n  EXTENT_SIZE (after any rounding).\n\nThe rounding just described is done explicitly, and a warning is issued\nby the MySQL Server when any such rounding is performed. The rounded\nvalues are also used by the NDB kernel for calculating\nINFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES column values and other purposes. However, to\navoid an unexpected result, we suggest that you always use whole\nmultiples of 32K in specifying these options.\n\nAUTOEXTEND_SIZE, MAX_SIZE, NODEGROUP, WAIT, and COMMENT are parsed but\nignored, and so currently have no effect. These options are intended\nfor future expansion.\n\nThe ENGINE parameter determines the storage engine which uses this\ntablespace, with engine_name being the name of the storage engine.\nCurrently, engine_name must be one of the values NDB or NDBCLUSTER.\n\nWhen CREATE TABLESPACE is used with ENGINE = NDB, a tablespace and\nassociated data file are created on each Cluster data node. You can\nverify that the data files were created and obtain information about\nthem by querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES table.

By default, a routine is\nassociated with the default database. To associate the routine\nexplicitly with a given database, specify the name as db_name.sp_name\nwhen you create it.\n\nThe CREATE FUNCTION statement is also used in MySQL to support UDFs\n(user-defined functions). See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/adding-functions.html. A UDF can\nbe regarded as an external stored function. Stored functions share\ntheir namespace with UDFs. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/function-resolution.html, for\nthe rules describing how the server interprets references to different\nkinds of functions.\n\nTo invoke a stored procedure, use the CALL statement (see [HELP CALL]).\nTo invoke a stored function, refer to it in an expression. The function\nreturns a value during expression evaluation.\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION require the CREATE ROUTINE\nprivilege. They might also require the SUPER privilege, depending on\nthe DEFINER value, as described later in this section. If binary\nlogging is enabled, CREATE FUNCTION might require the SUPER privilege,\nas described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/stored-programs-logging.html.\n\nBy default, MySQL automatically grants the ALTER ROUTINE and EXECUTE\nprivileges to the routine creator. This behavior can be changed by\ndisabling the automatic_sp_privileges system variable. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/stored-routines-privileges.html.\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be\nused when checking access privileges at routine execution time, as\ndescribed later in this section.\n\nIf the routine name is the same as the name of a built-in SQL function,\na syntax error occurs unless you use a space between the name and the\nfollowing parenthesis when defining the routine or invoking it later.\nFor this reason, avoid using the names of existing SQL functions for\nyour own stored routines.\n\nThe IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode applies to built-in functions, not to stored\nroutines. It is always permissible to have spaces after a stored\nroutine name, regardless of whether IGNORE_SPACE is enabled.\n\nThe parameter list enclosed within parentheses must always be present.\nIf there are no parameters, an empty parameter list of () should be\nused. Parameter names are not case sensitive.\n\nEach parameter is an IN parameter by default. To specify otherwise for\na parameter, use the keyword OUT or INOUT before the parameter name.\n\n*Note*: Specifying a parameter as IN, OUT, or INOUT is valid only for a\nPROCEDURE. For a FUNCTION, parameters are always regarded as IN\nparameters.\n\nAn IN parameter passes a value into a procedure. The procedure might\nmodify the value, but the modification is not visible to the caller\nwhen the procedure returns. An OUT parameter passes a value from the\nprocedure back to the caller. Its initial value is NULL within the\nprocedure, and its value is visible to the caller when the procedure\nreturns. An INOUT parameter is initialized by the caller, can be\nmodified by the procedure, and any change made by the procedure is\nvisible to the caller when the procedure returns.\n\nFor each OUT or INOUT parameter, pass a user-defined variable in the\nCALL statement that invokes the procedure so that you can obtain its\nvalue when the procedure returns. If you are calling the procedure from\nwithin another stored procedure or function, you can also pass a\nroutine parameter or local routine variable as an IN or INOUT\nparameter.\n\nThe following example shows a simple stored procedure that uses an OUT\nparameter:\n\nmysql> delimiter //\n\nmysql> CREATE PROCEDURE simpleproc (OUT param1 INT)\n    -> BEGIN\n    ->   SELECT COUNT(*) INTO param1 FROM t\n    -> END//\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> delimiter \n\nmysql> CALL simpleproc(@a)\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT @a\n+------+\n| @a   |\n+------+\n| 3    |\n+------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe example uses the mysql client delimiter command to change the\nstatement delimiter from  to // while the procedure is being defined.\nThis enables the  delimiter used in the procedure body to be passed\nthrough to the server rather than being interpreted by mysql itself.\nSee\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/stored-programs-defining.html.\n\nThe RETURNS clause may be specified only for a FUNCTION, for which it\nis mandatory. It indicates the return type of the function, and the\nfunction body must contain a RETURN value statement. If the RETURN\nstatement returns a value of a different type, the value is coerced to\nthe proper type. For example, if a function specifies an ENUM or SET\nvalue in the RETURNS clause, but the RETURN statement returns an\ninteger, the value returned from the function is the string for the\ncorresponding ENUM member of set of SET members.\n\nThe following example function takes a parameter, performs an operation\nusing an SQL function, and returns the result. In this case, it is\nunnecessary to use delimiter because the function definition contains\nno internal  statement delimiters:\n\nmysql> CREATE FUNCTION hello (s CHAR(20))\nmysql> RETURNS CHAR(50) DETERMINISTIC\n    -> RETURN CONCAT(''Hello, '',s,''!'')\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT hello(''world'')\n+----------------+\n| hello(''world'') |\n+----------------+\n| Hello, world!  |\n+----------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nParameter types and function return types can be declared to use any\nvalid data type, except that the COLLATE attribute cannot be used prior\nto MySQL 5.5.3. As of 5.5.3, COLLATE can be used if preceded by the\nCHARACTER SET attribute.\n\nThe routine_body consists of a valid SQL routine statement. This can be\na simple statement such as SELECT or INSERT, or a compound statement\nwritten using BEGIN and END. Compound statements can contain\ndeclarations, loops, and other control structure statements. The syntax\nfor these statements is described in\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/sql-syntax-compound-statements.h\ntml.\n\nMySQL permits routines to contain DDL statements, such as CREATE and\nDROP. MySQL also permits stored procedures (but not stored functions)\nto contain SQL transaction statements such as COMMIT. Stored functions\nmay not contain statements that perform explicit or implicit commit or\nrollback. Support for these statements is not required by the SQL\nstandard, which states that each DBMS vendor may decide whether to\npermit them.\n\nStatements that return a result set can be used within a stored\nprocedure but not within a stored function. This prohibition includes\nSELECT statements that do not have an INTO var_list clause and other\nstatements such as SHOW, EXPLAIN, and CHECK TABLE. For statements that\ncan be determined at function definition time to return a result set, a\nNot allowed to return a result set from a function error occurs\n(ER_SP_NO_RETSET). For statements that can be determined only at\nruntime to return a result set, a PROCEDURE %s can''t return a result\nset in the given context error occurs (ER_SP_BADSELECT).\n\nUSE statements within stored routines are not permitted. When a routine\nis invoked, an implicit USE db_name is performed (and undone when the\nroutine terminates). The causes the routine to have the given default\ndatabase while it executes. References to objects in databases other\nthan the routine default database should be qualified with the\nappropriate database name.\n\nFor additional information about statements that are not permitted in\nstored routines, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/stored-program-restrictions.html\n.\n\nFor information about invoking stored procedures from within programs\nwritten in a language that has a MySQL interface, see [HELP CALL].\n\nMySQL stores the sql_mode system variable setting that is in effect at\nthe time a routine is created, and always executes the routine with\nthis setting in force, regardless of the server SQL mode in effect when\nthe routine is invoked.\n\nThe switch from the SQL mode of the invoker to that of the routine\noccurs after evaluation of arguments and assignment of the resulting\nvalues to routine parameters. If you define a routine in strict SQL\nmode but invoke it in nonstrict mode, assignment of arguments to\nroutine parameters does not take place in strict mode. If you require\nthat expressions passed to a routine be assigned in strict SQL mode,\nyou should invoke the routine with strict mode in effect.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-procedure.html\n\n', '', 'http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-procedure.html'),

In the\n  latter case (without UNIV_DEBUG), the information on which the output\n  is based is insufficient to distinguish regular mutexes and mutexes\n  that protect rw-locks (which permit multiple readers or a single\n  writer).

The syntax of the FIELDS and LINES\nclauses is the same for both statements. Both clauses are optional, but\nFIELDS must precede LINES if both are specified.\n\nFor more information about the efficiency of INSERT versus LOAD DATA\nINFILE and speeding up LOAD DATA INFILE, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/insert-speed.html.\n\nThe character set indicated by the character_set_database system\nvariable is used to interpret the information in the file. SET NAMES\nand the setting of character_set_client do not affect interpretation of\ninput. If the contents of the input file use a character set that\ndiffers from the default, it is usually preferable to specify the\ncharacter set of the file by using the CHARACTER SET clause. A\ncharacter set of binary specifies "no conversion."\n\nLOAD DATA INFILE interprets all fields in the file as having the same\ncharacter set, regardless of the data types of the columns into which\nfield values are loaded. For proper interpretation of file contents,\nyou must ensure that it was written with the correct character set. For\nexample, if you write a data file with mysqldump -T or by issuing a\nSELECT ... INTO OUTFILE statement in mysql, be sure to use a\n--default-character-set option with mysqldump or mysql so that output\nis written in the character set to be used when the file is loaded with\nLOAD DATA INFILE.\n\n*Note*: It is not possible to load data files that use the ucs2, utf16,\nor utf32 character set.\n\nThe character_set_filesystem system variable controls the\ninterpretation of the file name.\n\nYou can also load data files by using the mysqlimport utility it\noperates by sending a LOAD DATA INFILE statement to the server. The\n--local option causes mysqlimport to read data files from the client\nhost. You can specify the --compress option to get better performance\nover slow networks if the client and server support the compressed\nprotocol. See http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysqlimport.html.\n\nIf you use LOW_PRIORITY, execution of the LOAD DATA statement is\ndelayed until no other clients are reading from the table. This affects\nonly storage engines that use only table-level locking (such as MyISAM,\nMEMORY, and MERGE).\n\nIf you specify CONCURRENT with a MyISAM table that satisfies the\ncondition for concurrent inserts (that is, it contains no free blocks\nin the middle), other threads can retrieve data from the table while\nLOAD DATA is executing. Using this option affects the performance of\nLOAD DATA a bit, even if no other thread is using the table at the same\ntime.\n\nPrior to MySQL 5.5.1, CONCURRENT was not replicated when using\nstatement-based replication (see Bug #34628). However, it is replicated\nwhen using row-based replication, regardless of the version. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-features-load-data.h\ntml, for more information.\n\nThe LOCAL keyword, if specified, is interpreted with respect to the\nclient end of the connection:\n\no If LOCAL is specified, the file is read by the client program on the\n  client host and sent to the server. The file can be given as a full\n  path name to specify its exact location. If given as a relative path\n  name, the name is interpreted relative to the directory in which the\n  client program was started.\n\n  When using LOCAL with LOAD DATA, a copy of the file is created in the\n  server''s temporary directory. This is not the directory determined by\n  the value of tmpdir or slave_load_tmpdir, but rather the operating\n  system''s temporary directory, and is not configurable in the MySQL\n  Server. (Typically the system temporary directory is /tmp on Linux\n  systems and C:\\WINDOWS\\TEMP on Windows.) Lack of sufficient space for\n  the copy in this directory can cause the LOAD DATA LOCAL statement to\n  fail.\n\no If LOCAL is not specified, the file must be located on the server\n  host and is read directly by the server. The server uses the\n  following rules to locate the file:\n\n  o If the file name is an absolute path name, the server uses it as\n    given.\n\n  o If the file name is a relative path name with one or more leading\n    components, the server searches for the file relative to the\n    server''s data directory.\n\n  o If a file name with no leading components is given, the server\n    looks for the file in the database directory of the default\n    database.\n\nNote that, in the non-LOCAL case, these rules mean that a file named as\n./myfile.txt is read from the server''s data directory, whereas the file\nnamed as myfile.txt is read from the database directory of the default\ndatabase. For example, if db1 is the default database, the following\nLOAD DATA statement reads the file data.txt from the database directory\nfor db1, even though the statement explicitly loads the file into a\ntable in the db2 database:\n\nLOAD DATA INFILE ''data.txt'' INTO TABLE db2.my_table\n\nWindows path names are specified using forward slashes rather than\nbackslashes. If you do use backslashes, you must double them.\n\nFor security reasons, when reading text files located on the server,\nthe files must either reside in the database directory or be readable\nby all. Also, to use LOAD DATA INFILE on server files, you must have\nthe FILE privilege. See\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/privileges-provided.html. For\nnon-LOCAL load operations, if the secure_file_priv system variable is\nset to a nonempty directory name, the file to be loaded must be located\nin that directory.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/load-data.html\n\n', '', 'http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/load-data.html'),

You can enforce a high degree of\nconsistency with the default REPEATABLE READ level, for operations on\ncrucial data where ACID compliance is important. Or you can relax the\nconsistency rules with READ COMMITTED or even READ UNCOMMITTED, in\nsituations such as bulk reporting where precise consistency and\nrepeatable results are less important than minimizing the amount of\noverhead for locking. SERIALIZABLE enforces even stricter rules than\nREPEATABLE READ, and is used mainly in specialized situations, such as\nwith XA transactions and for troubleshooting issues with concurrency\nand deadlocks.\n\nFor full information about how these isolation levels work with InnoDB\ntransactions, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-transaction-model.html.\nIn particular, for additional information about InnoDB record-level\nlocks and how it uses them to execute various types of statements, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-record-level-locks.html\nand http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-locks-set.html.\n\nThe following list describes how MySQL supports the different\ntransaction levels. The list goes from the most commonly used level to\nthe least used.\n\no REPEATABLE READ\n\n  This is the default isolation level for InnoDB. For consistent reads,\n  there is an important difference from the READ COMMITTED isolation\n  level: All consistent reads within the same transaction read the\n  snapshot established by the first read. This convention means that if\n  you issue several plain (nonlocking) SELECT statements within the\n  same transaction, these SELECT statements are consistent also with\n  respect to each other. See\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-consistent-read.html.\n\n  For locking reads (SELECT with FOR UPDATE or LOCK IN SHARE MODE),\n  UPDATE, and DELETE statements, locking depends on whether the\n  statement uses a unique index with a unique search condition, or a\n  range-type search condition. For a unique index with a unique search\n  condition, InnoDB locks only the index record found, not the gap\n  before it. For other search conditions, InnoDB locks the index range\n  scanned, using gap locks or next-key (gap plus index-record) locks to\n  block insertions by other sessions into the gaps covered by the\n  range.\n\no READ COMMITTED\n\n  A somewhat Oracle-like isolation level with respect to consistent\n  (nonlocking) reads: Each consistent read, even within the same\n  transaction, sets and reads its own fresh snapshot. See\n  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-consistent-read.html.\n\n  For locking reads (SELECT with FOR UPDATE or LOCK IN SHARE MODE),\n  InnoDB locks only index records, not the gaps before them, and thus\n  permits the free insertion of new records next to locked records. For\n  UPDATE and DELETE statements, locking depends on whether the\n  statement uses a unique index with a unique search condition (such as\n  WHERE id = 100), or a range-type search condition (such as WHERE id >\n  100). For a unique index with a unique search condition, InnoDB locks\n  only the index record found, not the gap before it. For range-type\n  searches, InnoDB locks the index range scanned, using gap locks or\n  next-key (gap plus index-record) locks to block insertions by other\n  sessions into the gaps covered by the range. This is necessary\n  because "phantom rows" must be blocked for MySQL replication and\n  recovery to work.\n\n  *Note*: In MySQL 5.5, if the READ COMMITTED isolation level is used\n  or the innodb_locks_unsafe_for_binlog system variable is enabled,\n  there is no InnoDB gap locking except for foreign-key constraint\n  checking and duplicate-key checking. Also, record locks for\n  nonmatching rows are released after MySQL has evaluated the WHERE\n  condition.

If the view does not exist,\nCREATE OR REPLACE VIEW is the same as CREATE VIEW. If the view does\nexist, CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW is the same as ALTER VIEW.\n\nThe select_statement is a SELECT statement that provides the definition\nof the view. (When you select from the view, you select in effect using\nthe SELECT statement.) select_statement can select from base tables or\nother views.\n\nThe view definition is "frozen" at creation time, so changes to the\nunderlying tables afterward do not affect the view definition. For\nexample, if a view is defined as SELECT * on a table, new columns added\nto the table later do not become part of the view.\n\nThe ALGORITHM clause affects how MySQL processes the view. The DEFINER\nand SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be used when\nchecking access privileges at view invocation time. The WITH CHECK\nOPTION clause can be given to constrain inserts or updates to rows in\ntables referenced by the view. These clauses are described later in\nthis section.\n\nThe CREATE VIEW statement requires the CREATE VIEW privilege for the\nview, and some privilege for each column selected by the SELECT\nstatement. For columns used elsewhere in the SELECT statement you must\nhave the SELECT privilege. If the OR REPLACE clause is present, you\nmust also have the DROP privilege for the view. CREATE VIEW might also\nrequire the SUPER privilege, depending on the DEFINER value, as\ndescribed later in this section.\n\nWhen a view is referenced, privilege checking occurs as described later\nin this section.\n\nA view belongs to a database. By default, a new view is created in the\ndefault database. To create the view explicitly in a given database,\nspecify the name as db_name.view_name when you create it:\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW test.v AS SELECT * FROM t\n\nWithin a database, base tables and views share the same namespace, so a\nbase table and a view cannot have the same name.\n\nColumns retrieved by the SELECT statement can be simple references to\ntable columns. They can also be expressions that use functions,\nconstant values, operators, and so forth.\n\nViews must have unique column names with no duplicates, just like base\ntables. By default, the names of the columns retrieved by the SELECT\nstatement are used for the view column names. To define explicit names\nfor the view columns, the optional column_list clause can be given as a\nlist of comma-separated identifiers. The number of names in column_list\nmust be the same as the number of columns retrieved by the SELECT\nstatement.\n\nUnqualified table or view names in the SELECT statement are interpreted\nwith respect to the default database. A view can refer to tables or\nviews in other databases by qualifying the table or view name with the\nproper database name.\n\nA view can be created from many kinds of SELECT statements. It can\nrefer to base tables or other views. It can use joins, UNION, and\nsubqueries. The SELECT need not even refer to any tables. The following\nexample defines a view that selects two columns from another table, as\nwell as an expression calculated from those columns:\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t (qty INT, price INT)\nmysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(3, 50)\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT qty, price, qty*price AS value FROM t\nmysql> SELECT * FROM v\n+------+-------+-------+\n| qty  | price | value |\n+------+-------+-------+\n|    3 |    50 |   150 |\n+------+-------+-------+\n\nA view definition is subject to the following restrictions:\n\no The SELECT statement cannot contain a subquery in the FROM clause.\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to system or user variables.\n\no Within a stored program, the definition cannot refer to program\n  parameters or local variables.\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to prepared statement parameters.\n\no Any table or view referred to in the definition must exist. However,\n  after a view has been created, it is possible to drop a table or view\n  that the definition refers to. In this case, use of the view results\n  in an error. To check a view definition for problems of this kind,\n  use the CHECK TABLE statement.\n\no The definition cannot refer to a TEMPORARY table, and you cannot\n  create a TEMPORARY view.\n\no Any tables named in the view definition must exist at definition\n  time.\n\no You cannot associate a trigger with a view.\n\no Aliases for column names in the SELECT statement are checked against\n  the maximum column length of 64 characters (not the maximum alias\n  length of 256 characters).\n\nORDER BY is permitted in a view definition, but it is ignored if you\nselect from a view using a statement that has its own ORDER BY.\n\nFor other options or clauses in the definition, they are added to the\noptions or clauses of the statement that references the view, but the\neffect is undefined. For example, if a view definition includes a LIMIT\nclause, and you select from the view using a statement that has its own\nLIMIT clause, it is undefined which limit applies. This same principle\napplies to options such as ALL, DISTINCT, or SQL_SMALL_RESULT that\nfollow the SELECT keyword, and to clauses such as INTO, FOR UPDATE,\nLOCK IN SHARE MODE, and PROCEDURE.\n\nIf you create a view and then change the query processing environment\nby changing system variables, that may affect the results that you get\nfrom the view:\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v (mycol) AS SELECT ''abc''\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SET sql_mode = ''''\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT "mycol" FROM v\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SET sql_mode = ''ANSI_QUOTES''\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT "mycol" FROM v\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n| abc   |\n+-------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses determine which MySQL account to\nuse when checking access privileges for the view when a statement is\nexecuted that references the view. The legal SQL SECURITY\ncharacteristic values are DEFINER and INVOKER. These indicate that the\nrequired privileges must be held by the user who defined or invoked the\nview, respectively. The default SQL SECURITY value is DEFINER.\n\nIf a user value is given for the DEFINER clause, it should be a MySQL\naccount specified as ''user_name''@''host_name'' (the same format used in\nthe GRANT statement), CURRENT_USER, or CURRENT_USER(). The default\nDEFINER value is the user who executes the CREATE VIEW statement. This\nis the same as specifying DEFINER = CURRENT_USER explicitly.\n\nIf you specify the DEFINER clause, these rules determine the legal\nDEFINER user values:\n\no If you do not have the SUPER privilege, the only legal user value is\n  your own account, either specified literally or by using\n  CURRENT_USER. You cannot set the definer to some other account.\n\no If you have the SUPER privilege, you can specify any syntactically\n  legal account name. If the account does not actually exist, a warning\n  is generated.\n\no Although it is possible to create a view with a nonexistent DEFINER\n  account, an error occurs when the view is referenced if the SQL\n  SECURITY value is DEFINER but the definer account does not exist.\n\nFor more information about view security, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/stored-programs-security.html.\n\nWithin a view definition, CURRENT_USER returns the view''s DEFINER value\nby default. For views defined with the SQL SECURITY INVOKER\ncharacteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the account for the view''s\ninvoker. For information about user auditing within views, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/account-activity-auditing.html.\n\nWithin a stored routine that is defined with the SQL SECURITY DEFINER\ncharacteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the routine''s DEFINER value. This\nalso affects a view defined within such a routine, if the view\ndefinition contains a DEFINER value of CURRENT_USER.\n\nView privileges are checked like this:\n\no At view definition time, the view creator must have the privileges\n  needed to use the top-level objects accessed by the view. For\n  example, if the view definition refers to table columns, the creator\n  must have some privilege for each column in the select list of the\n  definition, and the SELECT privilege for each column used elsewhere\n  in the definition. If the definition refers to a stored function,\n  only the privileges needed to invoke the function can be checked. The\n  privileges required at function invocation time can be checked only\n  as it executes: For different invocations, different execution paths\n  within the function might be taken.\n\no The user who references a view must have appropriate privileges to\n  access it (SELECT to select from it, INSERT to insert into it, and so\n  forth.)\n\no When a view has been referenced, privileges for objects accessed by\n  the view are checked against the privileges held by the view DEFINER\n  account or invoker, depending on whether the SQL SECURITY\n  characteristic is DEFINER or INVOKER, respectively.\n\no If reference to a view causes execution of a stored function,\n  privilege checking for statements executed within the function depend\n  on whether the function SQL SECURITY characteristic is DEFINER or\n  INVOKER. If the security characteristic is DEFINER, the function runs\n  with the privileges of the DEFINER account. If the characteristic is\n  INVOKER, the function runs with the privileges determined by the\n  view''s SQL SECURITY characteristic.\n\nExample: A view might depend on a stored function, and that function\nmight invoke other stored routines. For example, the following view\ninvokes a stored function f():\n\nCREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t WHERE t.id = f(t.name)\n\nSuppose that f() contains a statement such as this:\n\nIF name IS NULL then\n  CALL p1()\nELSE\n  CALL p2()\nEND IF\n\nThe privileges required for executing statements within f() need to be\nchecked when f() executes. This might mean that privileges are needed\nfor p1() or p2(), depending on the execution path within f(). Those\nprivileges must be checked at runtime, and the user who must possess\nthe privileges is determined by the SQL SECURITY values of the view v\nand the function f().\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses for views are extensions to\nstandard SQL. In standard SQL, views are handled using the rules for\nSQL SECURITY DEFINER. The standard says that the definer of the view,\nwhich is the same as the owner of the view''s schema, gets applicable\nprivileges on the view (for example, SELECT) and may grant them. MySQL\nhas no concept of a schema "owner", so MySQL adds a clause to identify\nthe definer. The DEFINER clause is an extension where the intent is to\nhave what the standard has that is, a permanent record of who defined\nthe view. This is why the default DEFINER value is the account of the\nview creator.\n\nThe optional ALGORITHM clause is a MySQL extension to standard SQL. It\naffects how MySQL processes the view. ALGORITHM takes three values:\nMERGE, TEMPTABLE, or UNDEFINED. The default algorithm is UNDEFINED if\nno ALGORITHM clause is present. For more information, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/view-algorithms.html.\n\nSome views are updatable. That is, you can use them in statements such\nas UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT to update the contents of the underlying\ntable. For a view to be updatable, there must be a one-to-one\nrelationship between the rows in the view and the rows in the\nunderlying table. There are also certain other constructs that make a\nview nonupdatable.\n\nThe WITH CHECK OPTION clause can be given for an updatable view to\nprevent inserts or updates to rows except those for which the WHERE\nclause in the select_statement is true.\n\nIn a WITH CHECK OPTION clause for an updatable view, the LOCAL and\nCASCADED keywords determine the scope of check testing when the view is\ndefined in terms of another view. The LOCAL keyword restricts the CHECK\nOPTION only to the view being defined. CASCADED causes the checks for\nunderlying views to be evaluated as well. When neither keyword is\ngiven, the default is CASCADED.\n\nFor more information about updatable views and the WITH CHECK OPTION\nclause, see\nhttp://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/view-updatability.html.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-view.html\n\n', '', 'http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/create-view.html'),

(486, 'INSERT DELAYED', 27, 'Syntax:\nINSERT DELAYED ...\n\nThe DELAYED option for the INSERT statement is a MySQL extension to\nstandard SQL that is very useful if you have clients that cannot or\nneed not wait for the INSERT to complete. This is a common situation\nwhen you use MySQL for logging and you also periodically run SELECT and\nUPDATE statements that take a long time to complete.\n\nWhen a client uses INSERT DELAYED, it gets an okay from the server at\nonce, and the row is queued to be inserted when the table is not in use\nby any other thread.\n\nAnother major benefit of using INSERT DELAYED is that inserts from many\nclients are bundled together and written in one block. This is much\nfaster than performing many separate inserts.\n\nNote that INSERT DELAYED is slower than a normal INSERT if the table is\nnot otherwise in use. There is also the additional overhead for the\nserver to handle a separate thread for each table for which there are\ndelayed rows. This means that you should use INSERT DELAYED only when\nyou are really sure that you need it.\n\nThe queued rows are held only in memory until they are inserted into\nthe table. This means that if you terminate mysqld forcibly (for\nexample, with kill -9) or if mysqld dies unexpectedly, any queued rows\nthat have not been written to disk are lost.\n\nThere are some constraints on the use of DELAYED:\n\no INSERT DELAYED works only with MyISAM, MEMORY, ARCHIVE, and BLACKHOLE\n  tables. For engines that do not support DELAYED, an error occurs.\n\no An error occurs for INSERT DELAYED if used with a table that has been\n  locked with LOCK TABLES because the insert must be handled by a\n  separate thread, not by the session that holds the lock.\n\no For MyISAM tables, if there are no free blocks in the middle of the\n  data file, concurrent SELECT and INSERT statements are supported.\n  Under these circumstances, you very seldom need to use INSERT DELAYED\n  with MyISAM.\n\no INSERT DELAYED should be used only for INSERT statements that specify\n  value lists. The server ignores DELAYED for INSERT ... SELECT or\n  INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE statements.\n\no Because the INSERT DELAYED statement returns immediately, before the\n  rows are inserted, you cannot use LAST_INSERT_ID() to get the\n  AUTO_INCREMENT value that the statement might generate.\n\no DELAYED rows are not visible to SELECT statements until they actually\n  have been inserted.\n\no Prior to MySQL 5.5.7, INSERT DELAYED was treated as a normal INSERT\n  if the statement inserted multiple rows, binary logging was enabled,\n  and the global logging format was statement-based (that is, whenever\n  binlog_format was set to STATEMENT). Beginning with MySQL 5.5.7,\n  INSERT DELAYED is always handled as a simple INSERT (that is, without\n  the DELAYED option) whenever the value of binlog_format is STATEMENT\n  or MIXED. (In the latter case, the statement no longer triggers a\n  switch to row-based logging, and so is logged using the\n  statement-based format.)\n\n  This does not apply when using row-based binary logging mode\n  (binlog_format set to ROW), in which INSERT DELAYED statements are\n  always executed using the DELAYED option as specified, and logged as\n  row-update events.\n\no DELAYED is ignored on slave replication servers, so that INSERT\n  DELAYED is treated as a normal INSERT on slaves. This is because\n  DELAYED could cause the slave to have different data than the master.\n\no Pending INSERT DELAYED statements are lost if a table is write locked\n  and ALTER TABLE is used to modify the table structure.\n\no INSERT DELAYED is not supported for views.\n\no INSERT DELAYED is not supported for partitioned tables.\n\nURL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/insert-delayed.html\n\n', '', 'http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/insert-delayed.html'),
